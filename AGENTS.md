# AGENTS.md — read me before touching anything

This repo is worked on by several assistants (Claude Code, ChatGPT/cowork) plus **Lucas**, the owner.
**Keep this file short.** It's read every session — if it grows, it costs everyone tokens.
These docs are in English for token efficiency. **This changes nothing about the app: all UI text stays in Rioplatense Spanish.** Lucas speaks Spanish — talk to him in Spanish.

## What this is
Two sibling apps, static vanilla site (**no build step**), one repo:
- **PWM** (movies/series) → `index.html`, `js/`
- **PRB** (books) → `prb/index.html`, `prb/js/`

Live at `lucasdonadio01.github.io/pwm/` and `/pwm/prb/` (GitHub Pages, publishes on push to `main`).

## Golden rules
1. **Shared code → `js/shared.js` (`APPKIT`)**, loaded by both apps: accounts + PIN, photo cropper, tier-row config, image export, toast. Don't duplicate it in either `app.js`.
2. **New data → JSON blobs in the `settings` table.** Never change the Supabase schema. Keys in use: `reading`, `watchmeta`, `tierlists`, `tierdata`, `tierrows`, `calendars`, `calevents`, `accounts`, `extra_films`, `extra_books`, `order`.
3. **There is REAL user data in Supabase.** Never bulk-delete `reviews`/`settings`. If you write while testing, clean it up afterwards.
4. **Cache-bust:** touched JS or CSS → bump `?v=N` in **both** `index.html` files. Otherwise stale assets ship (this already broke the "Leyendo" layout once).
5. **Footer version stamp:** `WM.build` / `PRB.build` in `js/data.js` and `prb/js/data.js`.
6. **Everything must stay free.** No build step, no npm at runtime, no paid services.
7. **All user-facing UI text is Rioplatense Spanish** (vos / mirá / elegí).

## Handoff protocol
**When you finish:** commit (never leave half-done work uncommitted) · mark status in `correcciones.md` (✅ / 🚧 / ⛔) · **replace** the Log entry below with yours · if Lucas must do something by hand, write it under "Needs Lucas" — the other assistant cannot see your chat.

**When you start:** read this file · run `git log --oneline -10` and `git status` · if there are uncommitted changes that aren't yours, **don't touch them** — ask first.

`correcciones.md` is Lucas's spec file and stays in Spanish.

## Needs Lucas
- None.

## Log — ONLY the latest entry. Replace it, don't append (history is in `git log`).

### 2026-07-24 · Codex
- PRB profile parity remains committed locally in `8466cd6`, still awaiting approval.
- PWM profile stats now default open and persist manual detail state locally; best-ranked titles show a measured 2.5-row preview with top and inline expansion controls.
- PWM now defaults to deterministic personal calendars. Custom sharing uses `pendingMembers` plus `calendar_share_invite` / `calendar_share_accept`; membership begins only after acceptance. Legacy `cal-main` is preserved as filtered “Calendario anterior”.
- Verified at 1280×720 and 390×844 without Supabase test writes. Assets v23; PWM 1.11 / PRB 1.11. Current batch awaits Lucas approval before push.
