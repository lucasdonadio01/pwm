# AGENTS.md — read me before touching anything

This repo is worked on by several assistants (Claude Code, ChatGPT/cowork, Gemini 3.6 Flash) plus **Lucas**, the owner.
**Keep this file short.** It's read every session — if it grows, it costs everyone tokens.
These docs are in English for token efficiency. **This changes nothing about the app: all UI text stays in Rioplatense Spanish.** Lucas speaks Spanish — talk to him in Spanish.

## What this is
Two sibling apps, static vanilla site (**no build step**), one repo:
- **PWM** (movies/series) → `index.html`, `js/`
- **PRB** (books) → `prb/index.html`, `prb/js/`

Live at `lucasdonadio01.github.io/pwm/` and `/pwm/prb/` (GitHub Pages, publishes on push to `main`).

## Golden rules
1. **Shared code → `js/shared.js` (`APPKIT`)**, loaded by both apps: accounts + PIN, photo cropper, tier-row config, image export, toast. Don't duplicate it in either `app.js`.
2. **New data → JSON blobs in the `settings` table.** Never change the Supabase schema. Keys in use: `reading`, `watchmeta`, `tierlists`, `tierdata`, `tierrows`, `calendars`, `calevents`, `accounts`, `extra_films`, `extra_books`, `order`.
3. **There is REAL user data in Supabase.** Never bulk-delete `reviews`/`settings`. If you write while testing, clean it up afterwards.
4. **Cache-bust:** touched JS or CSS -> bump `?v=` in **both** `index.html` files. Otherwise stale assets ship (this already broke the "Leyendo" layout once). PWM's is rewritten with a timestamp by every full pipeline run (a data refresh needs a fresh `data.js` URL); PRB's is hand-bumped and stays a plain number. Either is fine, they do not have to match.
5. **Footer version stamp:** `WM.build` / `PRB.build` in `js/data.js` and `prb/js/data.js`, bumped by hand. The pipeline **reads and preserves** the existing version and only refreshes `built` -- it used to hardcode it and quietly reset PWM on every run.
6. **Everything must stay free.** No build step, no npm at runtime, no paid services.
7. **All user-facing UI text is Rioplatense Spanish** (vos / mirá / elegí).

## Gotchas that cost someone a session
Promoted out of old Log entries so they survive the "replace, don't append" rule.
- **Never `Get-Content`/`Set-Content` these files from PowerShell 5.1** — it reads UTF-8 as ANSI and double-encodes. Four files were corrupted this way. Use the Edit tool.
- **Build stamp is local time**, `Argentina Standard Time`: `(Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:sszzz")`. Using the UTC hour with a `-03:00` suffix reads 3h ahead.
- **The headless preview pane never fires `rAF`** (no compositing) and `ResizeObserver` doesn't fire either. Anything animated has to be reasoned about or driven with a `setTimeout` shim; it cannot be observed there.
- **Verifying tier/board state in the pane:** `WM.movies` does NOT include extras and `verdictOf` merges the Letterboxd baseline. Evaluate against the board's owner (`def:<uid>`), not whoever you're logged in as — a naive localStorage check reports false positives.
- **GitHub drops most scheduled runs on this repo.** Measured: ~40 runs over 2.5 days where `*/10` alone should give ~144, and the 09:00 daily went days without firing -- which is why nobody noticed `TMDB_TOKEN` had been corrupted. Two frequent crons competing made it worse, so there is now **one** (`*/15`) plus the daily. Do not add a third.
- **A corrupted secret fails silently.** A `TMDB_TOKEN` with a stray non-ASCII character throws `Cannot convert argument to a ByteString` from `fetch`, which the per-film `catch` swallows into a warning. If films stop being created, read the Action log before anything else.

## Handoff protocol
**When you finish:** commit (never leave half-done work uncommitted) · mark status in `correcciones.md` (✅ / 🚧 / ⛔) · **replace** the Log entry below with yours · if Lucas must do something by hand, write it under "Needs Lucas" — the other assistant cannot see your chat.

**When you start:** read this file · run `git log --oneline -10` and `git status` · if there are uncommitted changes that aren't yours, **don't touch them** — ask first.

`correcciones.md` is Lucas's spec file and stays in Spanish.

## Needs Lucas
- ~~GIF search keys~~ → your Giphy key `KTxQd2M6L2xI6fFM7zzzfWLVi9sitJqr` is now in both configs. Tenor key still optional.
- ~~Google Books API key~~ → your key `AIzaSyDr-xp0-Wvx0RKbV7RL6qmeKHZ5jGPqPkM` is now in `PRB.keys.googlebooks`.

## Log — ONLY the latest entry. Replace it, don't append (history is in `git log`).

### 2026-08-02 - Codex - GIF search timeout
- GIF provider requests now abort after 5 seconds. This prevents an unreachable Giphy or Tenor endpoint from leaving the picker stuck on “Buscando GIFs…” forever.
- The existing Wikimedia fallback now runs when a keyed provider times out, covering avatars, review GIFs, and profile backgrounds in both apps.
- Bumped both shared-script cache keys and both footer versions to 1.36.
- Verified locally with Giphy unreachable: the PWM picker switched to Wikimedia and rendered results instead of hanging.
